			Register:

			Attempts to register to the default network. The
			default network is normally selected by the settings

			GetOperators:

			Retrieve array of operator object and properties.

			This method can be used to retrieve the current
			operator list.  This is either an empty list (when
			not registered to any network) or a list with one
			or more operators (when registered).

			This list will also return cached values of previously
			seen networks.  Manual updates to list can only be
			done via the Scan method call.

		<!--
			Scan:

			Runs a network operator scan to discover the currently
			available operators.  This operation can take several
			seconds, and up to several minutes on some modems.
			This can be used to help the user determine what is
			the best operator to use if forced to roam on a
			foreign network.

			NOTE: The operator scan can interfere with any active
			GPRS contexts.  Expect the context to be unavailable
			for the duration of the operator scan.

					 #org.ofono.Error.NotImplemented
					 #org.ofono.Error.Failed
					 #org.ofono.Error.AccessDenied

			Mode:

			The current registration mode. The default of this
			is "auto", but can be changed during operation. This
			property will change to "manual" if the Register()
			method of an operator is called.

			The possible values are:
				"auto"       Network registration is performed
				             automatically.
				"auto-only"  Network registration is performed
				             automatically, and manual
				             selection is disabled.
				"manual"     Network operator is selected
				             manually. If the operator is
				             currently not selected,
				             registration is not attempted.

			Status:

			The current registration status of a modem.

			The possible values are:
				"unregistered"  Not registered to any network
				"registered"    Registered to home network
				"searching"     Not registered, but searching
				"denied"        Registration has been denied
				"unknown"       Status is unknown
				"roaming"       Registered, but roaming
